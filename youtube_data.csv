Elon Musk ruined the API part, you can use some other APIs

Here's one of the subscriber built the same project using other APIs - https://chenmeiqiao.notion.site/How-I-Reach-Out-to-YouTubers-I-Like-As-A-Data-Engineer-c37bdddefde54c3789229ffa5a789432

or you can use a static dataset from Kaggle and then use Airflow to process it
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmmarchetti/tweets-dataset

FAQ:
1. Twitter removed free access: It still has free access but with limits of requests you can make - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api

2. You need to request for V2 access: You will get an error but just by reading the doc you should be able to access Elevated Access

One small question. Sorry it's not related to DE but ETL.
Do I need know ETL for a data analyst jobs in India ?
I have looked Job desctiption of data analyst jobs in India and the US & I saw this pattern of ""requiring knowledge of ETL & Data Warehouse"" in most DA jobs in India where as DA jobs in the US have least number of requirements.

I don't know what is the ground reality of Data Analyst jobs in India but things like those make me scare away from applying to DA jobs in the country until I get ETL knowledge(my brain tells me that). Now I don't know heck about ETL because my professional Certification did not cover ETL so I am unable to freely apply for jobs and feel chained due to not knowing that one ETL technology.

Elon Musk ruined the API part, you can use some other APIs

or you can use a static dataset from Kaggle and then use Airflow to process it
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmmarchetti/tweets-dataset

FAQ:
1. Twitter removed free access: It still has free access but with limits of requests you can make - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api

2. You need to request for V2 access: You will get an error but just by reading the doc you should be able to access Elevated Access
